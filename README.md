# **Blinkit X Zudio - Fashion in Hours!** ðŸš€  

## **Overview**  
Imagine if **Blinkit** and **Zudio** collaboratedâ€”combining Blinkitâ€™s **quick delivery infrastructure** with Zudioâ€™s **affordable fashion**. What if we could order clothes online and have them **delivered in just a few hours** instead of days? That would be game-changing!  

## **The Idea**  
- Blinkit already delivers groceries in minutes.  
- Zudio has stores all over India with trendy and budget-friendly clothing.  
- Instead of instant delivery, **fashion orders can be fulfilled within a few hours**, making it both **fast and convenient**.  

## **Prototype Features**  
âœ… **Blinkit-style interface** with a mode switch for clothes.  
âœ… **Blinkit X Zudio logo** for the collaboration.  
âœ… **Checkout system** displaying cart items and total price.  
âœ… **Working payment flow** with an animation confirming "Delivery in 2 hours!"  

## **Note**  
This is just a **prototype**â€”no real tracking or order processing is implemented. Itâ€™s an exploration of how **quick fashion delivery** could work in the future! ðŸš€
